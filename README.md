# Creating a Genome Database based on Marker Genes of Interest

This repository contains workflows for searching publicly available databases of isolate genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) for a specific marker gene. This high-throughput workflow can be applied for any marker gene of interest with a correspond Hidden Markov Model (HMM). These workflows were made specifically for creating databases for genes related to mercury and methylmercury cycling to create and periodically update the MeHg Database.
